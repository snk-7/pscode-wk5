// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

 Sum Integer A and Inteeger B

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If Integer is dividable by 2 it is even, if not it is odd

// Exercise 3:

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
